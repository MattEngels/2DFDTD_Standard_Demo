# 2DFDTD_Standard_Demo
2-Dimensional FDTD code from Dr. J.B. Schneider's book "The Finite-Difference Time Domain Method"

You should be able to download and compile this code on any system with any C/C++ compiler.  I have personally
tested it on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio Community and on Linux (Mint 17/18 and Ubuntu 17/18 with Nvidia
Nsight Eclipse edition.
